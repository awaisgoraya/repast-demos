/**
* 
* Each Moth moves randomly in a given area. If a moth encounters a
* light intensity/source it tries to move only in a point where there is 
* light intensity. The moth moves at a faster speed called the Excited 
* Speed when it is in the illuminated region. The moth is illuminated (shown
* by a change in size) when it is in that region. The moth dies if it touches 
* the core of the light source. 
* 
* The Model has a fixed light source at the center (0,0). Although the size and 
* intensity of the source is variable. For multiple light sources, check out : 
* http://code.google.com/p/cscs-repast-demos/wiki/MothAdvance 
* 
* Model can be used to study the rate at which the moth discover light source and
* calculating the average life-cycle of the moth. The model can also be useful to
* study the effect of intensity in the average life cycles.
*
* See
*
* http://code.google.com/p/cscs-repast-demos/wiki/MothBasic
*
* for a full description of the model and details.
