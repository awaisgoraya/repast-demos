= Installing a Demo Model =
To install a demo model, click on the download link in the summary section on that model's page. For example, the summary section of the [AreaCoverage Area Coverage] model contains a download link that looks like:

* Download     : http://repast-demos.googlecode.com/files/areaCoverage-1.0.1.zip

Once that has finished downloading,

 # Open eclipse, if it is not already open.
 # From the file menu, click on Import
 # Under the General section, click on "Existing Projects into Workspace", then click Next
 # Click the "Select archive file" radio button, and browse to the downloaded zip file.
 # Click Finish

This will import the demo model into your current workspace. Once it has been imported, you can then run it from within Eclipse, as you would any other Repast model.
